   1. .. rubric:: What is the Metadata Editor?
         :name: what-is-the-metadata-editor

The Metadata Editor is an application designed to help document data
collection operations (i.e. household surveys) undertaken for different
kinds of research projects. The application is developed and supported
by the World Bank and provides a high quality open architecture tool
primarily targeting data producers in developing countries. The Metadata
Editor applies various metadata standards recognized as global models
for defining and describing different kinds of data. The following
metadata standards are integrated into the Metadata Editor:

-  The Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) is an international standard
   used to define data collection activities such as surveys and provide
   a structure for documenting key survey elements and data to promote
   and facilitate research.

-  The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) is an international
   standard used to describe web based resources, electronic documents
   and physical resources. The DCMI is a metadata template used for
   describing a resource.

-  ISO 19139 is an international industry standard used for describing
   geospatial information. The standard includes information about the
   “identification, constraint, extent, quality, spatial and temporal
   reference, distribution, lineage, and maintenance of the digital
   geographic data-set”.  [1]_

The Metadata Editor allows a data archivist a tool to systematically
approach the process of data documentation by defining the following
projects:

-  Surveys

-  Time Series

-  Geospatial

-  Statistical Tables

-  Standalone publications or documents

Why is it necessary to use the Metadata Editor?

Aiding the researcher discover data or publications is critical to the
research process and enhancing the visibility of the agency that is
disseminating statistical information. The process of documenting a
project is only part of the broader concept of data curation. Data
Curation is an overarching process that includes data documentation but
also includes the process of presenting the data for use. The Metadata
Editor should be part of an integral strategy to promote the use of data
and enhance data quality.

What is the purpose of the manual? 
-----------------------------------

This manual is designed to provide guidance in the process of
documenting a project. The manual is organized around workflow and
functionality. Sections 1-6 deal mostly with the workflow of the
documentation process. Section 7 provides an item by item review of the
menu items and their functionality.

The manual is organized as follows:

-  Section 2 covers basic workflow issues and cover the creation of
   projects and highlight the different kind of projects now available.
   Template management issues are also covered. The entire workflow for
   setting up a project, including importing data is covered. The
   section will also help the user familiarize themselves with the new
   dashboard layout.

-  Section 3 covers provides guidance for documenting a project. The
   section includes guidance on how to manage different projects and
   provide quality tips in documentation. Throughout the manual, quality
   control is emphasized as part of the publication process.

-  Section 4 covers documentation at the variable level and include data
   file descriptions and variable statistics.

-  Section 5 covers variable grouping to enhance the presentation of
   variable level metadata and ease the discovery process.

-  Section 6 covers linking external resources or any documents such as
   questionnaires or methodology that could be useful to a researcher.

-  Section 7 provides an item by item description of all the menu items
   as a reference guide.

The Metadata Editor is designed to interface better with the National
Data Archive (NADA) application and allow for easier exchange of
metadata with a data catalog, discovery and dissemination tool.

How do I prepare to document a project?
---------------------------------------

Before documenting and archiving a project, ensure that all the relevant
information needed for properly documenting a project is available.
Setting up a project for documenting requires setting up a file
structure that is effective and useful to the archivist and facilitates
the process. The archivist or data curator should collect the data and
documents related to the project under a project folder on a server. It
is recommended that the data and documentation are placed in separate
folders under the project folder. The documentation generated by the
Metadata Editor such as the xml, wbm**. rdf and JSON can be kept in the
project root directory.

\**Note: wbm file in the screen shot

-  Data:

Make sure the data is the definitive final version of the data and that
it has been anonymized and properly treated for dissemination according
to clearly defined data dissemination policies and well-defined data
processes. Depending upon whether the data will be a Public Use File or
available as a licensed data file, different assumptions may have been
used to include or exclude certain variables. An institution may also
want to document the raw unedited data to assure that the original data
as it was processed during the data collection event is archived.
Different uses for the data may require different levels of treatment of
the data files. Make sure the right data is being documented for the
specific purpose.

-  Documents

Gather up all the related documents to the project. A great deal of
auxiliary information is generated in the process of planning and
executing a data collection project. Place all the documents in a folder
for that project. This includes vital information such as:

-  Questionnaires for surveys and censuses

-  Methodological documents

-  Project reports and conclusions

-  Analytical documents

-  Relevant dissemination policies

-  Other reference material useful to the researcher

Once the data curator has defined a project space and collected the data
and documents relevant for the applicable project and assured proper
procedures have been followed, the process of documentation will be
greatly facilitated.

-  Policy and Process

Make sure that proper process is followed when documenting the project.
Many organizations will have a process manual with checklists and sign
off requirements before the document is deemed fit for dissemination. If
no such document exists, as a data curator, it may be necessary to take
note of the processes that are used and record them as the basis of a
process document. These could form the basis for defining a more
coherent process manual. The better a process is defined, the higher the
likelihood of better quality data and metadata.

What do I do with the data after documenting a project?
-------------------------------------------------------

This is a fundamental question for the data curator. Data curation
requires that the end-product for documenting the project is known and
produced with the highest degree of quality. The value of documenting a
project is to encourage use of the data. A project may have multiple
levels of access. The level of documentation and the final platform for
the project will depend on the final use of the data. Data curation does
not stop at the end of the documentation phase. Data curation requires
the purposeful release of the data to the user community with proper
announcement and ease-of-access and ultimately the monitoring of the use
and the production of research papers which can be cited. The ultimate
value of a well-documented project is the number of relevant
publications that are produced as a result of the availability of the
data.

Installation \*\*
-----------------

\**need to finalize

The Metadata Editor can be installed on Windows, Mac and Linux (Ubuntu).
The applications are available from here [**].

There are two ways to install the application:

-  Directly from a zip file: If a zip file is downloaded or received for
   the Metadata Editor, simply unzip the contents of the file in the
   desired location. The application will be unzipped with the
   highest-level folder added to the path where the zip file is located.
   Once unzipped, go into the folder with the contents of the
   application and look for the executable file entitled:
   MetadataEditor.exe. The executable file can be recognized by the
   |image1| icon. Create a shortcut on the Desktop to this executable
   file. To do this,

   -  Right click the file and select the SEND option and then the
      DESKTOP.

Work Flow 
==========

Section 1 provided introductory information on the Metadata Editor and
prepared the user for the documentation process. The user should have
prepared the environment and have the required data, documentation and
file structure ready for archiving.

The Metadata Editor is designed around a project. This project will
depend on the kind of data or resource being documented and archived.

This section is designed to provide the user with guidance in creating a
project. It will take the user through all the necessary steps to define
the workspace and prepare the project for documentation. This section
will cover:

-  Creating a project

-  Using the Template Manager

-  Importing data

The section will also help familiarize the user with the dashboard
layout and managing the project using the functionalities provided
through the dashboard. Two practical exercises are provided:

-  How to create and share a project template

-  How to import data into a project

   1. .. rubric:: Getting Started
         :name: getting-started

..

   The Metadata Editor has a workspace environment that is both
   menu-driven and dashboard managed. The specific commands under the
   menu are described in Section 7. The following sections will cover
   the functionalities of the Metadata Editor through the workflow of
   documenting a project and will focus mostly on the dashboard
   management of projects.

   After the application has loaded the user is taken to a Dashboard
   that includes the following areas:

-  Create New Project: This allows the user to create a project of the
   type listed by simply clicking the type of project desired. This is
   found on the left margin.

-  Recent Projects: This provides a list of the projects that have
   recently been opened.

-  Opened Projects: This provides a list of the projects that are still
   open on the right margin.

   2. .. rubric:: Projects
         :name: projects

The manual will now take the user through the process of creating a
project through the dashboard. The table below provides the user with a
brief explanation of the kinds of projects that are available.

\**note reference to wbm

If the user is creating a project, the user will notice the choice of
the project types are provided in the left-hand column. Simply click the
kind of project that is being documented.

|image14|

When the user creates a project, the Metadata Editor will open a tabbed
interface. All the metadata elements that are to be filled will be
displayed under the project tab.

If the user has a project open, the Metadata Editor will overlay the
open project with the one just created under a NEWSTUDY tab. The default
name given to a created project is NEWSTUDY(X) where (X) is a number
representing a sequential number of the new studies that are open.

It is recommended to save out the project to the appropriate location
and provide the project with an adequate name. The project can be saved
by clicking the |image15| icon.

|image16|

Note the name change in the tab provided in the screen shot. The project
can be saved by clicking the save icon provided in the upper left (see
arrow).

Also note the various options provided in the black control bar.

|image17|

-Save project: This shortcut allows the user to save the current
project.

|image18|

-Open project: This shortcut will allow the user to open a created
project.

|image19|

-Delete project: This shortcut will delete the project completely.

|image20|

-Import Dataset: This shortcut allows the user to import the relevant
data.

|image21|

-External Resource: This shortcut allows the user to create the space
for attaching an external resource.

|image22|

-Template: This shortcut allows a user to access the template manager.

|image23|-A shortcut to return to the dashboard panel is provided in the
upper right-hand corner. Clicking it will take the user back to the
initial landing page.

As the project will be defined by the templates which supply the
formats, the next section will provide the user with information on the
templates and the template manager.

Templates
---------

The Metadata Editor uses ‘templates’ or standardized formats that are
subsets of the much larger standard. Metadata standards often include
many fields that are valid or valuable in certain circumstances and can
be very specialized. To help the documentation, process the IHSN has
generated a series of templates that simplify the process of
documentation. Each template will have its own *default values* as well
as an IHSN recommended selection of metadata fields.

The Metadata Editor makes use of three standards: the DDI, Dublin Core
and the ISO19139

-  **DDI: Data Documentation Initiative**

..

   The DDI is “\ *an international standard for describing the data
   produced by surveys and other observational methods in the social,
   behavioral, economic, and health sciences*\ ”. The Metadata Editor
   employs the DDI Codebook. This “\ *is a more light-weight version of
   the standard, intended primarily to document simple survey
   data*\  [2]_.” For more information please see their web site at:
   https://www.ddialliance.org.

   **DCMI: Dublin Core Metadata Initiative**

   *The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative develops and maintains
   specifications in support of resource description resources*.
   Resources can be any electronic file that is to be described and can
   include files such as: MP3 files, PDF, satellite images, tables,
   Microsoft Word documents etc. These are referred to as External
   Resources in the Metadata Editor as they are resources that help
   describe a project. In the case of the survey, they can include
   manuals, questionnaires. etc. For more information please see their
   web site at: http://dublincore.org. [3]_

-  **ISO19139**

   The ISO19139 is related to the ISO19115. The ISO19115 is a metadata
   standard for describing geospatial data. The ISO19139 provides the
   means of implementation or the XML schema. Both are related and are
   part of an International Standard for defining handling geo-spatial
   information. The Metadata Editor uses the XML schema ISO19139. For
   more information, please see the following site:
   https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:19115:ed-1:v1:en.

The table below provides an overview of the different metadata standards
as related to the project. Each metadata standard is integrated into the
template that will define the project.

|image24|

**Accessing** the Template Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The template manager is accessible by clicking the shortcut |image25|
   in the black control bar. When the user clicks the template icon, the
   following screen will be displayed. Note there are three sections.

-  To the left the user can select the language of the template.

|image26|

-  Project specific templates are defined along the top. Select the
   template that corresponds to the project being documented.

..

   |image27|

   Under the selected tab, all the available templates will be displayed
   and saved in the respective language folder.

-  On the right-hand side, the user will see the following choices:

|image28|

-Set as default: Allows to define the default template to use each time
a project of this kind is created. Once it is selected, it will be used
in other projects of the same kind.

-New: Allows the user to create a custom template usually based on the
default..

-Edit: Allows to modify the content of an existing template. The user
selects the template then clicks the EDIT option.

-Delete: Allows deletion of the template from the manager This option
(and the edit ) is not available for the default template.

-Duplicate: This option will duplicate the selected template.

-Import: This option is used to select a template and bring it into the
template manager. It will display the Windows file explorer. The
expected file format will be JSON Schema.

-Export: This option exports the selected template as a JSON file.

-This will close the File Manager and return to the project.

Default Template: The user will notice that a default template is
provided. This template is recognizable as it is indicated with the icon
|image29| to the left of the default template.

Note the following specifications under each template.

Survey (DDI) \*\*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Need to add content for all here when the templates are done.

3. .. rubric:: Time Series*\*
      :name: time-series

4. .. rubric:: Geospatial*\*
      :name: geospatial

5. .. rubric:: Document*\*
      :name: document

6. .. rubric:: Table))
      :name: table

7. .. rubric:: Tips for starters
      :name: tips-for-starters

Note: When the user return to the project workspace the user will notice
that the main section of the workspace contains specifications on the
project and the tree control on the right-hand side will reflect the
selected template.

Note the specifications below. The user will notice a heading entitled
“Template”. There is an active control provided at the end of the name
of the active template. This control provides the user with a shortcut
to select a template for a project.

|image30|

Clicking that control will display a “Change Template” box that displays
all the templates. The user can verify the selected template and change
the selection through this shortcut.

|image31|

Select the template desired and click the USE button in the lower
left-hand corner of the box.

Note: When trying to “EDIT” a template, if the user do not select a
template to edit and click the edit button, an error message will
appear:

|image32|

If this happens, simply select the template and click the EDIT button.
Selecting the template will highlight the choice.

Importing datasets into a Project
---------------------------------

   The previous sections helped the user create a project and save the
   project. It also covered the process for setting a template for the
   project. This section will now cover the process required for
   importing a data file or several data files.

   By the end of this section, a user will have created and saved and
   undocumented project that includes the data.

   The user should have assembled the required documents and data for
   documentation. Datasets should be stored in a separate subfolder in
   the project directory.

   The user can import various data formats directly into the project.
   The Metadata Editor will accept most data files from standard
   statistical packages. The list below shows the file formats that are
   currently supported.

\**For SPSS ‘.sav’ files the Metadata Editor uses the defined measure
unless this is very different from what seems logical. In these
instances, the user will be asked during the import process, whether the
measure definitions should be changed.

\**Users are reminded to check the measure values that are assigned when
‘.por’ files are imported and when exporting as a ‘.sav’ file.

Importing one data file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   There are various ways to import a data file into the project.

   |image33|

-  From the control bar, click the icon. This will display the Windows
   Explorer. Note the file formats that are available. The Metadata
   Editor requires that the file format be one of the formats provided
   in the drop-down box. If it is not, it will not be visible. Select
   the file to import and click OPEN.

..

   |image34|

-  Another way to access the datafile import functionality is through
   the datafile folder or node in the control tree to the right. Note
   the three dots |image35| beside the Dataset node. Clicking this, the
   Metadata Editor will display the “Import Dataset” option. Simply
   select this option and the same Windows Explore box will be displayed
   as above. Select the data file to import and click OPEN.

..

   |image36|

-  A data file can also be imported using the menu option >Data>Import
   dataset. This is covered in Section 7 along with all other menu
   driven options.

Once having successfully imported a datafile the appearance of the node
in the tree control to the left will change. Under the folder dataset
note the name of the file [child] and a virtual folder that will provide
the key elements for describing the datafile. In addition, the
[Variable] will display the variable names and the control for
documenting each variable. The [Data] node displays the data values.
More will be covered in the next sections which deals with document the
project.

|image37|

Importing multiple datasets into one project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image38|\ Importing multiple datafiles can also be done. Following the
same procedure already outlined, from the Windows Explorer box, simply
select multiple files by clicking the check box to the left of each file
to be imported. Then click OPEN. Each file will be displayed in its own
node.

Deleting and manipulating a datafile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an error has been made or for any reason the datafile needs to be
deleted or moved, just click the three dots to the right of the specific
data file and note the options:

|image39|

Deleting a data set will remove it from the project.

A dataset can be moved up or down depending on the desired order.

Adding Metadata
===============

Section 2 sets up the process of documentation and the workflow for
beginning a project. The section continues the workflow process and will
cover the following topics:

-  documenting the project

-  managing projects and navigation

-  quality of metadata

This section will also delve deeper into the functionalities of the user
interface.

1. .. rubric:: Setting Preferences*\*
      :name: setting-preferences

2. .. rubric:: Variable Relations*\*
      :name: variable-relations

The Metadata editor allows the user to set preferences. These
preferences are…

Documenting a project
---------------------

   Much of the work that is required to document a project is in the
   preparation. Section 1 covered the documents and material required
   for documenting a project. There were also recommendations for
   developing a file structure to help organize the process of
   documentation. This section is organized under three metadata
   standards that have already been discussed: the DDI, the DCMI and
   ISO19139. It will provide guidance in managing the process of
   entering metadata. Much of the information on the specific metadata
   standards is provided in the template. This section covers the
   higher-level metadata elements. Section 4 will cover documenting at
   the variable level. Before looking at the specific standard, there
   are a few additional functionalities that apply to all templates.

Common terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A series of common terms are established to help guide the input
process. The following is provided as a reference:

   |image40|

-  Element: This is a defined field of metadata. An element will have an
   XML tag associated with it. The manual will refer to DDI elements or
   ISO19139 elements. In this case, this will be the individual field to
   be documented. Elements are given as the bottom most item in a tree.
   The screen shot displays elements of the DDI

-  Groups: Elements can be grouped into folders that are provided to
   simplify data documentation and manage the process by grouping
   similar elements.

-  Parameters: An element may have various parameters that help define
   the content.

   2. .. rubric:: Definitions
         :name: definitions

..

   To help in the process of understanding the content required for the
   element that is displayed, a description of the element is provided.
   This description provides the user with a better idea of formats,
   content and documentation for that element. The descriptions help to
   avoid redundancies in the documentation process.

Working with a grid of metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Metadata Editor has different modes of data entry. A grid may be
   provided to help assure completeness of the element. Each of the
   parameters under an element should be completed. The screenshot shows
   4 parameters under the Metadata Producer element of the DDI: Name,
   Abbreviation, Affiliation and Role. These parameters are unique to
   the element. The header row is always highlighted in gray.

   |image41|

   Note the controls on the right. These allow the addition and deletion
   of rows of additional producers. Each record of a Metadata Producer
   will have the same 4 parameters.

   |image42|\ Clicking this option will allow the user to add rows or
   records under the element. It does not provide the facility to insert
   but appends a row to the bottom of the list.

   |image43| Clicking this option will allow the user to delete the row
   or record. This control will allow for the deletion of the row where
   the cursor is found.

   |image44| Clicking this will move the record where the cursor is
   found up or down in the list.

   Note: The selected row will always be highlighted in blue with the
   active field displayed by an orange box. The cursor will be visible
   and flashing inside the active field.

   |image45|

Working with Controlled Vocabulary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Controlled vocabulary is also often called a “drop-down” box. It
   provides a selection of possible terms for the user to select. Many
   of the DDI elements have controlled vocabulary. The elements with
   controlled vocabulary can be identified by an arrow control to the
   right of the entry box:

   |image46|

   Clicking the arrow will display the choices that have been provided
   by the Metadata Editor.

   |image47|

   A user of the Metadata Editor is limited to the choices provided. If
   a user tries to enter a choice that is not provided, the application
   will return a message “No result found”.

5. .. rubric:: Working with dates
      :name: working-with-dates

   A user will also encounter elements that require dates. Keeping track
   of key dates in the production process is vital in the process of
   documentation. The Metadata Editor will require that a date me
   provided in Month-Day-Year format with a 4-digit year.

   |image48|

   There are three ways to capture the date. Note that there are two
   controls provided for this element to the right of the entry field.
   These provide two alternatives for entering the date:

-  Calendar: The large downward-pointing arrow will display a calendar
   where the user can then pick the date.

   |image49|

   The date field provides an input mask for direct entry from the
   keyboard.

   The Calendar control will allow navigation by:

   -Selecting the month drop down which helps navigate months and the
   years. The current year is displayed as a month calendar. Moving the
   scroll bar will allow the user to find a year. Moving the scroll bar
   up, will take the user back in time and moving the scroll bar forward
   will move the user forward,

   |image50|

   |image51| The controls to the right of the box allow the user to move
   forward and backward month-by-month.

   Note: A user must select the date by pressing the |image52| record
   button. This button will record the selected date into the date
   field.

-  Dial the date: Selecting the double arrow control |image53| will
   allow the user to move sequentially through a dial of numbers that
   are valid for that selection. The user will notice that a selection
   is required for MM (month) DD (day) and YYYY (year). Each item is
   highlighted in blue. Select the proper month-day-year. If a month-day
   and year is not provided, the entry will not be recorded. In the
   screen shot, the month is highlighted, and the user can click through
   the dial of numbers. Note that there is an X visible to the left.
   Clicking the X will remove the entry in the field.

   |image54|

-  Keyboard entry: A user can simply key in the entry for MM-DD-YYYY
   from the keyboard. Only valid entry values will be allowed. Note that
   months and days have leading 0s for one-digit selections.

Mixed entry
~~~~~~~~~~~

   On occasion the Metadata Editor will provide a mixed entry interface.
   This could be a grid entry with a date entry. Examples of this are in
   the Date of Collection and Time Periods. These are discrete periods
   that can be defined as repeating cycles in fielding a survey. This
   kind of data entry will require the start date and the end date of
   each discrete event. Note the screen shot provided. The two controls
   will work in similar ways only they are combined.

   |image55|

   Note the calendar controls under the “Start” parameter and the grid
   controls provided to the right.

Regular entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Most of the fields of data entry are defined as “Regular Entry”.
   These are text entry fields that accept direct entry from the
   keyboard or pasted from a source document. These fields are text and
   cannot be formatted. Right click controls for cutting and pasting are
   not available. A user will have to use keyboard shortcuts such as
   Ctrl+X (cutting) and Ctrl+V (pasting).

   Please note the drag control at the bottom right of the entry field.
   Clicking and dragging this field will allow the user to pull up or
   down the field and enable the user to see more of the content space.

   |image56|

Mandatory Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Mandatory elements are those elements that must have an entry and are
   flagged as “empty” during the internal quality control process.
   Mandatory elements are indicated by a red asterisk (*) to the right
   of the element label.

\*This is not part of the DCMI but is used by dependent applications to
help group the documents.

Metadata Groups 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Metadata Editor has the facility to group metadata elements in
   groups or categories that are related. These are virtual groupings
   and can assist the user by providing discrete related elements that
   represent a stage in the process of documenting a project. A group is
   recognized by a folder with a label. Note the grouping provided
   below. Clicking the folder will reveal the elements contained in that
   group.

   |image58|

   Note that selecting the group folder will display all elements in
   that group on the screen together. Reviewing the metadata or entering
   by group can speed-up the process of documenting. The screen shot
   provides a view of the data entry screen grouped by “Overview”.

|image59|

Note the arrow at the upper right-hand corner |image60|. Clicking this
arrow will hide the grouped content.

Highest level Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Clicking the highest-level class will also allow the user to
   visualize the content in a different fashion. This will display all
   the content that has been entered. However, the content is not
   editable. Note that any elements that are empty will not be displayed
   on the screen.

Managing projects and navigation 
---------------------------------

The previous section introduced the user to the workspace provided in
the Dashboard. The section only covered the functionality to create. A
user may find the additional functionality of the dashboard useful.

The user can return to the dashboard by clicking the |image61| button to
the right of the workspace.

The workspace will provide labels of all projects with a total number
given n the upper left (see screen shot). The project type is given by
the icon. The icon types are provided in Section 2.

Recent Projects: The main display of the dashboard are the recent
projects. This section will provide a running list of the projects that
have been created or opened. Unless the user removes the project by
clicking the X on the upper right of the project tab, the project
remains available to be browsed and easily retrieved.

|image62|

|image63|

Project types can also be easily searched by using the search
functionality. The search is done on the name of the project. By typing
the name in the seach bar, the projects will automatically be filtered
and displayed until only those projects with the name that matches what
is in the search box are provided.

Note the right of the Dashboard provides tabs of all open projects. This
allows the user to navigate between projects easily.

|image64|

Clicking the project will open that project and the user will be taken
to the project to review, edit or continue the documentation process.
Note that in the workspace, tabs are also created that allow the user to
navigate without returning to the Dashboard.

The tabs below in the editing mode reflect the open projects in the
Dashboard above.

|image65|

Opening a project: A user may find it useful to open a project that is
not listed in the “Recent Projects” list. In this case, the user will
have to use the menu options to navigate to the project.

|image66|

The user will select the File>Open Project and using the Windows
Navigator select the project to open.

Quality Tips
------------

Quality of output is very important when producing publicly browsable
content. Remember that this is a public document and a rigorous review
process should be implemented before releasing the content on a public
web site. These quality tips are provided to the user to assist with the
process of documentation:

Cutting and Pasting:

The Metadata Editor allows a user to cut and paste content from any
document into the editor. The content is unformatted text. All the text
in the Metadata Editor is unformatted. Make sure when cutting and
pasting content, it is properly reviewed, and relevant information is
provided. Check areas where formatting in the source document may cause
the content to display in an unprofessional manner. Always doublecheck
content that is cut and pasted.

Keystroke controls:

The Metadata Editor does not have right click cut and paste options. The
user will have to use keystroke controls such as Ctrl+V to copy and
Ctrl+C to paste. Note the various shortcuts available.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Understand the descriptions:

Each metadata element is provided with a description of what is expected
under the content. The user should review the content provided and make
sure they understand what the element requires. Only provide content
that is sought for under that element.

The following table provides useful shortcuts to help in the
documentation process.

Datasets
========

In Section 2 the user learned how to import a dataset into a project.
Section 3 covered the basics for documenting the higher-level elements
of a project.

This section will go into deeper details on the documenting process and
follows the workflow process to the variables. The section will
introduce the user to the following concepts and processes:

-  Data File Description

-  Variable level documentation including

-  Variable Statistics

-  Variable Documentation

-  Variable Information and Categories

-  Navigating through variables

-  Grouping variables

-  Viewing data

By the time the user has read through this section, he or she will have
a basic understanding of documenting the different projects to the
variable level.

Data File Description
---------------------

The user should already have imported some data files as this was
covered in Section 2. The data files are grouped under the icon
“Datasets”. Clicking the highest-level icon, or Datasets will display a
grid of all the datasets with some summary information. This includes:
Name, File type, Number of variables, Number of cases (records) and the
location of the data file.

|image67|

Clicking the next level of the individual data file will provide the
user with another summary page however note that the name of the
datafile is editable at this level. Placing the cursor in this field
will allow the user the ability to change the label of the datafile.

|image68|\ |image69|

As the user drills down deeper into the individual datafile he or she
will note that each datafile in the project will have the following
content structure with: File Description, Variables and Data (see blue
arrows).

|image70|\ The “File Description” contains various elements much the
same way as Document Description and Study Description. The difference
is that each data file within the Datasets will have its own file
description. The user will see 6 items displayed under File Description:
Contents, Producer, Version, Processing Checks, Missing Data and Notes.

The interface will display all items when clicking the upper level File
Description icon |image71|

or individually by clicking |image72|.

The fields of entry are regular entry data fields and follow the same
procedure for entering and editing content as covered in the previous
section.

Variable Information
--------------------

Clicking the |image73| icon of the individual datafile, will take the
user to the lowest level documentation functionality available on the
Metadata Editor. There is a great deal of information required to
document for each variable. The user will note the main sections of the
interface that are displayed:

The following main sections are noted: Variables, Documentation,
Categories, Variable Information.

Variables
~~~~~~~~~

The Variable section of the interface provides a grid of all the
variables in the data file. The user can scroll up and down the list by
moving the scroll bar to the right.

|image74|

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note the following table below for a summary of the variable information
available on the grid. The grid displays only default information. Note
that a user can display more as desired. This is described later in the
section.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Default Variable Information      |
+===================================+===================================+
| Number **NE**                     | This is a non-editable number     |
|                                   | generated by the Metadata Editor. |
|                                   | It is a one-up number with the    |
|                                   | prefix V. This is standard across |
|                                   | all datafiles.                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Name **E**                        | This is the short name for the    |
|                                   | variable. There are various       |
|                                   | conventions that can be used to   |
|                                   | name the variable but a standard  |
|                                   | across surveys should be used.    |
|                                   | The variable name is used in      |
|                                   | statistical applications as the   |
|                                   | handle to the content of that     |
|                                   | variable.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Label **E**                       | This column displays the          |
|                                   | descriptive label of the          |
|                                   | variable. This can be as long as  |
|                                   | required to help describe the     |
|                                   | variable without defining it.     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Width **E**                       | This field will display the       |
|                                   | number of characters that have    |
|                                   | been defined for that variable.   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Start Col **E**                   | This column is a computed value   |
|                                   | that is based on the width of the |
|                                   | fields. This is used for defining |
|                                   | the data dictionary (see box      |
|                                   | below). This is the position in   |
|                                   | the data file where that variable |
|                                   | value begins.                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| End Col **E**                     | This column is the position in    |
|                                   | the data file where the variable  |
|                                   | value ends.                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Record **E**                      | This is a unique identifier for   |
|                                   | the datafile. It is rarely used   |
|                                   | and is provided a default value   |
|                                   | of \*. If the data file being     |
|                                   | exporting requires a record       |
|                                   | identifier in the ASCII file or   |
|                                   | text file, then this field can be |
|                                   | used to insert a value.           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Decimals **E**                    | This value is the number of       |
|                                   | decimal positions that would be   |
|                                   | part of the variable. If for      |
|                                   | example, the variable length is 3 |
|                                   | characters and there are          |
|                                   | characters under decimals, the    |
|                                   | variable would have a value of    |
|                                   | x.xx.                             |

Categories
~~~~~~~~~~

|image80|

Categories are a vital form of metadata. These can be called *value
sets* and they are the value that some numeric values take. A common
category type can be a simple “Yes” or “No” response where the value for
Yes is 1 and the value for No is 2. In the Metadata Editor, the
categories that are defined are associated with nominal and ordinal
variables. The datatype is usually defined as numeric and the measure is
defined as nominal or ordinal.

The categories will be displayed with the value and the label as shown.

Note that the variable is the response related to possessing a birth
certificate.

|image81|\ Categories can be maintained by selecting options from the
control to the right of the categories box. Just click the desired icon
for: adding, deleting and moving the category up od down in the list.
When adding a category, the application will append to the bottom of the
list and not insert. It may be necessary to create a value and then move
it up the category list.

.. _variable-information-1:

Variable Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Metadata Editor allows the user to browse and check the variable
information in different ways. As has already been shown, one way to
browse the variable information is to click on the ellipsis to the right
of the variable grid |image82|.

This will display a list of options. The user can check those items to
be displayed on the grid.

|image83|\ Note in the selection provided, the default values are
checked in green. An optional series of variable information can be
provided by simply selecting the item.

The user will also note that the unchecked items are represented in the
screen display to the lower left under the title of “Variable
Information”.

|image84|

Data Type
~~~~~~~~~

Data type provides a drop-down box when clicking the |image85| to the
right of the field that define the type of data for that variable. A
list of choices will be provided:

|image86|

Numeric
^^^^^^^

Numeric variables are used to store any number, whether integer or
floating point (decimal). When a dataset is imported the values within
the variable are analyzed and the most appropriate storage format is
used. This guarantees that the file takes up as little space as
possible.

|image87|\ Selecting Numeric will also display a “Measure” field. This
will provide the user with the opportunity to define the numeric measure
used. The following measures can be selected:

Nominal, Ordinal and Scale.

**Nominal:**

This is the simplest type of measure whereby we only have names and
labels for categories. There is no order implied in the ordering of the
categories and no one category is better, or greater than another.

   Example: Marital Status 1. Married

2. Single

3. Divorced

4. Widowed

**Ordinal:**

   An ‘Ordinal’ measure has an implied order, or rank within the
   categories.

   Example: How strongly do you agree with this statement...?

1. Strongly agree

2. Agree

3. Disagree

4. Strongly disagree

**Scale**

   A ‘Scale’ variable contains numerical data that is generally
   ‘continuous’ in nature, and contains the actual response given.

   Examples: What is your income for the previous month?

   How many employees does your company employ?

Fixed string
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A fixed string variable is a variable with a predefined length which can
be set in the ‘String Length’ field below the ‘Data Type’ box.

|image88|

Using fixed string variables is very efficient as the strings are stored
in an array and are fast to store and retrieve. A fixed string variable
uses the same character set/encoding as the machine it runs on. There is
no limit on the number of characters but some software such as SPSS may
have character limits. It is recommended to keep a fixed string between
1 and 255 characters in length.

If the user changes the string length, the following warning message
will be provided:

|image89|

This warning message provides the user with a reminder that any value in
the datafile for that variable will be cut or cropped to that length.
Any trailing characters will need to be accounted for on the datafile.

Dynamic string
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A dynamic string variable is a variable with no limit to its length.
Each item of information is stored as a separate object in the file and
is therefore much less efficient to store than fixed string variables
and also takes more time to retrieve. However, unlike for fixed string
variables, empty cells are not stored. Dynamic string variables are
stored in Unicode format and should only be used only when a few cells
contain long string information. Dynamic strings should not be used if
the content of the variable is less than 20 characters in length.

Date
^^^^

The date field is selected when storing date information. The user will
note there are many options available when clicking the options arrow:

|image90|

Note the designation:

Y is for year.

M is for month

D is for day

The number of characters for year, month or day is provided by the
number of times the designation repeats:

YYYY is a four-character year

YY is a two-character year

The order in which the designation is provided is the order the year,
month and day mush be entered.

Is Time Variable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a dataset contains a ‘Time’ variable, e.g. Year, then the ‘\ **Is
Time Variable**\ ’ checkbox should be selected.

Min and Max
^^^^^^^^^^^

These two variable information options will display the minimum and the
maximum values for that variable in the datafile.

Decimals
^^^^^^^^

This field is used to define the number of decimal characters that are
defined for the variable.

Missing Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is where missing values for the data are defined. When defining
missing variables, the user will notice that the selected field where
the cursor is will be indicated by a green bar below the field
indicating that the field is active. In the case below, the value 9
would be considered missing data.

|image91|\ |image92|

Variable Documentation
----------------------

This section will cover the variable level documentation. Before going
into detail on the documentation or metadata that can be displayed and
related to the variable, note that the use will navigate through the
variable list provided under the variable section. The highlighted bar
will always indicate the active variable that is displayed on the
“documentation” section. Moving the bar up or down will change the
display of documentation.

|image93|

The Documentation section provides two tabs: Statistics and
Documentation.

Statistics
~~~~~~~~~~

The statistics tab will display the various selection of statistics
available in the selection box. Not all statistics should be displayed
for all variables. This will depend on the data type and measure. The
user should take the time to browse the metadata available under the
statistics tab to review the variables before documenting.

|image94|

The following options are available. Each section will display some
initials in parenthesis. These stand for: N=Nominal, O=Ordinal, S=Scale
and St=String. The values in the parenthesis is the recommended
statistics for the measure or data type contained. For example, there is
no need to display a mean for nominal variables.

Include Frequencies (N,O)

Ticking the box entitled Include Frequencies will display the
distribution of that response for the category provided. Both the value
and label will be displayed with a horizontal bar chart and percentage
displayed of the number of responses for that category.

|image95|

Summary Statistics

The remainder of the statistics will be displayed under the title:
Summary Statistics. For the example provided, the summary statistics
display the age of the head of household.

|image96|

.. _documentation-1:

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clicking the documentation tab will display a very important screen. The
user will note a screen that provides entry fields that are grouped in
categories and have the same appearance as documenting the higher-level
categories. Each variable has its own collection of important metadata
that should be documented if applicable.

|image97|

The user will notice that the variable level documentation is organized
into 4 folders:

Description: This section consists of four elements and describe the
variable.

Question: This section is where the documenter will place question text
such as the literal question.

Imputation and Derivation: this section identifies the variables that
are computed or imputed.

Other: Other key elements that should be documented

The table below gives a summary of the elements available for
documentation. Not all variables will have metadata associated with the
element. The user should document what is pertinent and available to the
user of the data.

Navigation Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following tips are provided to help the user navigate through the
frames and data entry fields.

|image106|

The control found in the upper right of the category frame will allow
the user to toggle the view of the frames from horizontal to vertical.

When navigating over a frame it may be difficult to see the scroll bar.
Hover over the right- hand part of the frame and the scroll bar will
appear

|image107|

The user will notice a control on the margin of the vertical frames.
This allows the user to expand or collapse the frame and make more room
on the screen for documenting. The small whit indicator arrow will
change depending on whether it is in the expanded or contacted position.

Data View
---------

The Metadata editor provides the user with the facility to view the
data. The user will note that there is a Data node in the tree control
to the left\ |image108|. Clicking that icon will display a screen that
contains the rows and columns of data. This screen is not editable but
only allows the user the ability to browse the data.

|image109|\ The user will also notice an ellipsis to the right of the
data icon. Clicking this will give the user the ability to import an
ASCII dataset.

Quality Tips
------------

The following tips are provided to the archivist in order to assure a
high-quality product at the variable level. Documenting variables can be
a tedious work to do correctly. But the value provided to the user of a
well-documented dataset is critical to making the dataset use-friendly.

User: Always think about what the user needs. The archivist is
documenting the project for users to discover information that would
assist them in researching questions. Helping the user navigate through
the variables and providing guidance as efficiently as possible may help
the researcher discover important findings in the data as well as
falling into error.

Review the ICPSR guide for documenting variables. This provides a
valuable guide to naming and labeling conventions. The ICPSR guide
should be a companion to documenting a project.
https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/deposit/guide/

Always check the variable statistics and assure only the necessary
statistics are displayed. For example, don’t display the mean and
standard deviation for nominal variables.

Make sure the nominal variables are properly labeled or described in the
categories.

Variable Groups
===============

Variable groups are applicable for those projects that have data.
Variable groups are virtual groupings of variables and are intended to
help the user browse data that can be grouped under a subject. Variables
in a survey can be found in many different sections of data files.
Variable groups bring these all together for easier exploratory browsing
or review.

Variables can be grouped by themes or related subjects. For example, a
group of variables under “Employment” could group personal
characteristics from a household roster (such as age or sex) and include
them with employment questions or income questions and entitle the
group: Labor.

Variable groups can be accessed by clicking the node in the tree
entitled “Variable Groups”.

|image110|

This will display the following screen:

|image111|

The user will notice the two tabs to the right. These will help organize
the process of grouping. Variable groups can also allow for nesting
sub-topics or sub-groups. I may want to classify Labor and have
subgroups: formal and informal.

Creating and Deleting Variable Groups
-------------------------------------

Variable groups are created by clicking into the “Variable Groups”
section and clicking the relevant control:

|image112|

The (+) will create a variable group and provide it with the default
value “Variable Group X”.

The trash-bin below will allow the user to remove a variable group/

|image113|\ After creating a variable group note the default value
“Variable Group X” is provided. These will need to be labeled under the
“Description” tab.

When deleting a variable group, simply highlight the group. The delete
control will show blue when active.

Describing the variable groups*\*
---------------------------------

View the available information under the description tab. This work area
will allow the user to describe the group.

Adding variable to groups 
--------------------------

Having described the various folders, it is possible to now add the
variables into the group. Click the Variables tag. Note the following
display:

|image114|

This shows a blank slate awaiting the variables assigned to the folder.
Note that the display will show the dataset, the variable number, the
name of the variable and the label. This process of reviewing can also
add to the quality of output by obliging a review of the variable level
metadata.

|image115|\ Note the control to the right of the grid:

Variable Selection Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clicking the (+) will display the following box. This will provide the
user with a grid of variables to be selected. Note the drop-down box
under the title: Dataset. Clicking the arrow will allow the user to
select the datafile in the dataset from which to select the variables to
be assigned to the group.

|image116|

The user can browse the selection and click the variables I want one by
one by highlighting and adding to the grid by clicking the (+). When
selecting a variable, note that the display to the right will show some
summary statistics.

|image117|

Clicking the OK button will add the variable or variables to the group.

Adding variables across the dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The advantage of grouping variables is that variables across datafiles
in the dataset can be displayed. Note in the example below the datafile
identifier. This group will contain variables assigned from the “child”
file and the “head of household”.

|image118|

Deleting variables in a group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the user wants to delete variables in a group, simply highlight the
variable and click the trash bin.

Navigation
----------

It is useful to understand how to navigate through the variables to
increase productivity. The following section gives some hints and
insights into the navigation of variable groups.

Searching the files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user can filter through the variables in the datafile by clicking to
the left of the column header on the variable grid. This will display a
filter control and the user can select the criteria for which they want
to filter.

|image119|

The choices provided are shown below:

|image120|

The user would select the condition and then enter the search text in
the search box.

Returning to the original datafile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image121|\ The user will notice the small arrow |image122|\ in the
series of controls provided at the right side of the work space when in
the variable tab.

Clicking the arrow will take the user to the datafile for that variable
in the Datasets. Notice when clicking the arrow, the application will
move into that section and the user no longer has control of the
variable group.

External Resources
==================

|image123|

Section 1 discussed the process of preparing a project. This process
required the gathering of reports, manuals and documents that would help
explain the project. Up to this point the metadata capture and the
documentation process was focused on developing the metadata document
structured by the metadata standard: DDI or ISO 19139 and through entry
of information in fields that correlate to the standards. These related
to project types with data such as: surveys and time series or
geospatial data.

However, capturing the metadata also means conveying certain key
documents to the user. Not all the detail of a project can be captured
in the fields that are provided in the project templates. Providing the
user with the original source documentation can be a very valuable
addition to the project. A user may find it useful to refer to discrete,
related documents such as: survey questionnaires, enumerator manuals,
survey reports, methodological documents.

Each of these electronic documents can be attached to the project and
form part of the dissemination package that should be available to the
researcher.

The metadata standard used to describe these stand-alone documents is
called the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative or DCMI..

Dublin Core
-----------

The Dublin Core template used by the Metadata Editor consists of the
following elements.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Managing External Resource
--------------------------

There are three options that are available for managing external
resources. Right clicking on the |image124| will display the choices:

|image125|

-  Add External resources

-  Import Dublin Core

-  Export Dublin Core

|image126|\ Note that the template can be selected by clicking the
pencil icon |image127|\ when at the highest node in the “External
Resource” tree. In case the user wants to modify the Dublin Core, he or
she will need to go into the Template Manager and select the “Dublin
Core” tab and then modify accordingly. The modified template will then
be available and listed when returning to the template selection area
and clicking the |image128| .

To add an external resource, click on the |image129| to the right of the
node entitled External Resources. This will display a choice of options.
Select “Add External Resource”. Notice that a new node has been created
under the External Resources with the default name: Resource 1 (the
number assigned is a sequential number).

|image130|\ Note that all the DCMI elements have been grouped into the
three folders that are now available: Identification, Contributor(s) and
Rights and Content.

The most important steps before adding the descriptive elements is the
need to change the display title and linking the resource.

Linking the External Resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the most important parts of assuring that the external resource
is provided to the user is to assure that a link to that reference is
provided. Note after adding the External Resource there is a node with
the outline of two persons: |image131|. Click this node and note the
screen in the workspace. There are two choices for linking the external
resource: URI or File.

URI: This stands for Uniform Resource Identifier. The user should insert
the location of the file. This is usually a web address that is
accessible through http or https. Often, publications may already be
available on-line as a PDF and can be accessed through the URI (in this
case the location of where the document is found on the web). For
example:
http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw-stat-2005/docs/expert-papers/Unicef%20for%20Geneva.pdf
is a URL that provides a link to the PDF. Simply click the URI radio
button and place the link in the field provided.

Note that the link can be checked by clicking the |image132| icon at the
right of the field. In this case

|image133|

the document will be downloaded as it refers to a PDF.

File: In preparing the external resources, it was recommended that all
external resources be placed in a separate folder. Each of these files
can be linked as required. Click the File radio button and select the
file that should be added as an external resource. Note that there are
two control icons at the rig hot the file path entry field.

|image134|\ Clicking the first icon first icon |image135| will allow the
user to browse the files using Windows Explore and link to the
appropriate document.

The second icon |image136| allows the user to upload the document into
the project.*\*

Changing the title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image137|\ When creating an external resource, the Metadata Editor will
automatically provide a default name “Resource X” where X is a serial
number that is generated based on the number of resources that have been
added. In order to change the name click on the “Identification” folder
and go to the field named “Title”. Note there is an asterisk to the
right of the label “Title”. This indicates that the field is a required
field. Note that the default title “Resource 1” in this case changes to
the actual title input into the field.

Documenting the external resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the external resource has been linked and properly titled, the
user can then document the elements of the Dublin Core. A table is
provided with references to the kind of content that should be included
in the field.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

\**How to delete an external resource?

|image138|

Importing and Exporting the Dublin Core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to adding a resource, the Metadata Editor allows the user to
import and export the Dublin Core. This can be done by returning to the
top most node in the External Resource tree and click the |image139|
icon and selecting the appropriate choice. Selecting the |image140| will
provide the user with a Windows Explored screen where the Dublin Core
can be selected (imported) or saved (exported). When importing or
exporting the Dublin Core the file format will be .rdf. If importing or
exporting an .rdf file with multiple documents, all document references
will be available.

|image141|

Project Types using the Dublin Core
-----------------------------------

Although external resources can be attached and linked to a project such
as a survey, there are also two project types that reflect the Dublin
Core. The user will notice that the templates for Tables and Documents
are based on the Dublin Core.

.. _quality-tips-2:

Quality Tips
------------

-  Always have all the documents available in a specific folder. It is
   often helpful to group the documents according to the “types” as
   provided in the Metadata Editor.

-  Always double check the path for files that are provided. These
   should be relative paths.

-  When cutting and pasting content, always check to make sure that the
   spacing and special characters are properly displayed.

-  Double check the output and make sure that the content is properly
   conveyed to the user and is useful for research purposes.

-  Provide as much relevant documentation to the user. If the project is
   a survey be sure to include the questionnaires and any survey reports
   with methodological details.

Publisher Menu Items
====================

   This section contains a comprehensive reference list of each menu
   item and includes information about each item, what it does and how
   it can be used. The menu items are illustrated in the screen shot
   below.

   |image142|

File Menu
---------

|image143|\ The following options are available under the File Item:

File>Open
~~~~~~~~~

Opening a project allows the user to browse the computer or network
using Windows File Explorer to access and use an already created
Project. When the project is successfully opened, a new tab will be
created providing the user with the workspace for the project. The
project is opened using a specific project extension file. This file
contains pointers and instructions that will keep all the associated
files referenced. Opening a project is usually used on the computer of
the archivist that is working on a project. When sharing information
with others, an archivist will need to consider the formats. The formats
for sharing projects are covered under File>Import (New Project).

File>Import (New Project)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Projects can be shared in different formats. Because project
documentation may use many references an archivist may want to be
selective in sharing a project. The format may include: data, external
resources or just metadata. There are several options available when
importing a project. These first require that files for import have been
created under File>Export or File>Documentation. Recreating a full
project may require more than one import operation.

File>Import (New Project)>Package*\*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A package is a zip file that contains a full project and the associated
data and documentation. The package must first be saved out (see
File>Export package for details). This option is used when sharing a
full project with all associated data and external resources.

File>Import (New Project)>DDI (Codebook 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option imports the DDI codebook 2. This is the metadata schema of
the DDI XML that is supported by the Metadata Editor. This format will
not carry any data or external documents and is only used in the case of
sharing the documention of a survey or census type project that would
use the DDI.

File>Import (New Project)>Geospatial (ISO19139 XML)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option is used only for importing the geospatial XML in ISO 19139
format.

File>Import (New Project)>Dublin Core/RDF*\*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option would be used for importing the Dublin core. The format does
not carry the external resources. If the RDF contains documentation on
external resources, the physical document will need to be provided
separately and linked. This option would also be used when importing a
“Tables” or individual document project.

File>Import (New Project)>Nesstar Study*\*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option will allow the user to import Nesstar files. The Nesstar
format is a proprietary format that is a legacy format for many
statistical offices. This file format contains the data but not the
external resources of a project. This option would be used by a
statistics office or agency that has documented many projects using the
Nesstar Publisher and wants to review or update the file formats to the
new Metadata Editor format.

File>Create new project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The File>Create new project will display a sub menu consisting of the
following:

|image144|

This option is used when creating a new project. Selecting any one of
these submenu items will have the same result as opening a project as
discussed in Section 2. A new tab will be created for the new project.
The File>Create new project can be used with the File>Import (New
Project) to overlay existing project documentation on a new project.

File>Save
~~~~~~~~~

The File>Save option is only available when never having saved a
project. When a project has been created, notice that a default name is
given of “New Study #. A sequential number will be provided to the New
Study by default. When selecting the save option the application will
prompt for a file name. Be sure to provide it a name that will identify
the project.

If the project has already been saved, the File>Save option will be
grayed out. The project name is retained in memory and only changes to
that document will re-activate the File>Save. If the option is greyed
out and the project needs to be saved for any reason, make sure the next
option is selected, which is File>Save As.

File> Save As
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option allows saving a project and overrides the File>Save option
(if it is greyed out). The project can be freely named or saved in any
location and with any name.

File>Delete
~~~~~~~~~~~

The File>Delete option will completely remove the project file from the
computer. It will not delete the data or the external resources that
have been linked. The data and documents remain in their folder. Only
the references to the data and external resources will be deleted as
will the project file.

File>Close
~~~~~~~~~~

The File>Close option will close the current project. The user will be
prompted with an option box to save the project before closing. The user
can save or opt to close without saving.

|image145|

File>Export Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option will save the project and all resources and data associated
with the project in a zip file. When selecting this option, the user
will be prompted to provide a name for the zip package.

The zip file will contain the following items:

|image146|

Note:

-  CSV Data: If data has been attached to a project, the packaging will
   convert the file to a comma separated value format. Each data file
   will be saved out as a CSV.

-  The I18n folder contains a JSON file with language specific
   parameters.*\*

-  The Resource folder contains all external resources that have been
   linked to a project

-  The template folder contains the specific template that was used to
   document the project

-  The Data base file contains all the metadata associated with the
   project. The application makes use of a database to manage the
   metadata of a project.

-  The projectinfo JSON file contains the key instructions (as text) and
   parameters required by the application to recreate the structure
   including: data files, metadata and exteral resources.

   9. .. rubric:: File>Preferences
         :name: filepreferences

..

   The Metadata Editor makes use of the R package. Because the R package
   used requires various dependencies the Metadata Editor ships with a
   version of R and required dependencies. The only option available is
   to not use the default version of R. Note: This preference is rarely
   changed and would require programming knowledge in R and changing the
   version will likely result in performance failure.

File>Language*\*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option allows the user to change the language of the interface of
the Metadata Editor. It will also provide the instruction to creating
the language file used in the Export>Package option.

Exit
~~~~

Selecting this option will exit the application entirely. The
application is closed and no longer available on the taskbar. If changes
have been made to the project, the user will be prompted to save the
changes before exiting the application.

Documentation Menu
------------------

The Documentation menu option allows the user to import or export the
various metadata standards that are now included in the Metadata Editor.
The term “Documentation” is used to define the content that is available
in a standardized format and is designed for sharing content.

The options that are available in the sub menu are:

|image147|

Documentation>Import
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Importing a document allows users of the Metadata Editor to import the
metadata of a project. This function has much of the same functionality
found under the File>Import option. However, the Document>Import only
uses project metadata files. This is useful when sharing metadata
content. This functionality can be very useful when dividing up labor
and assigning tasks to different persons for the same project.

The user is provided with a series of submenus depending on the metadata
required by the project. Note the following options:

-  DDI: This is the metadata content associated with a survey or a
   census.

-  Dublin Core: This is the documentation associated with any external
   resources that have been linked to a project.

-  Geospatial (ISO 19139): This is used to import geospatial metadata

-  Document: This is used for stand-alone documents and follows the
   Dublin Core.

-  Table: This option is used to import the document of a table. It also
   follows the Dublin Core.

-  Package: This will import a zip file with all related data and
   external resources. This has the same effect as the
   File>Import>Package option.

When importing a DDI or a package file, the user will be provided an
option to import sections of the project document. The archivist can
select the specific sections to be imported.

|image148|

The table provides descriptions of the primary sections which can be
imported:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Item                              | Description                       |

|                                   | document.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

|                                   | project or data collection. This  |
|                                   | could be the survey description   |
|                                   | of a survey project.              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

|                                   | project or study.                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Variable Information              | These are the variable labels.    |

Note: Make sure that the template used by the document being imported is
available in the work environment. The template can be imported
automatically if the project is saved as a package.

Documentation>Export
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Documentation>Export option will allow the user to export the
project in three formats: DDI, RDF and JSON.

-  DDI

This is primarily used for survey projects. When exporting a DDI
document, the Metadata Editor is designed to undertake a quality check
that includes assuring that any mandatory fields defined in the template
are not empty. Trying to export a DDI with any of the fields empty, will
generate the following alert:

|image149|

The example provided is based on the default DDI template and in this
case included 8 mandatory fields. In this example, the mandatory fields
are:

DDI Document ID Number

Title

Study ID Number

Country

Primary Investigator

Dates of Collection

Citation Requirement

Disclaimer

-  Dublin Core/RDF

The Dublin Core export will produce a Dublin Core document of the
metadata of all the external resources that are linked to a project.
Note that the document will not package the actual reference documents
but provide only the metadata. The documents would have to be exported
as a package under the File>Export Package document.

-  JSON

Exporting the JSON file will produce a Java Script Open Notation
document. This is a lightweight exchange format that is easy to parse
and use in applications.

Documentation > PDF Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PDF stands for Portable Document Format. It is a file format that
captures content and shares it across platforms. A PDF is free from
viruses and is a common way to distribute content. In order to view the
PDF the computer being used will need a copy of Adobe Acrobat. This is
free software available at the Adobe Acrobat web site:

https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/pdf-reader.html

Generating a PDF and not having the Acrobat Reader will result in being
unable to read the document that was generated.

Data Menu
---------

The Data menu item provides the user with easy access to import and
export data sets to and from a project. The compatible data formats that
are used by the Metadata Editor are:

-  .dta files or STATA file

-  .sav or SPSS files

-  .csv or comma delimited files. Note that these will not transport
   metadata.

-  .sas7bdat or SAS files

The two options provided under this menus item allow the user to import
and export the data files.

Variables Menu
--------------

There are three options for managing variable level information. These
are:

-  Resequence

-  Spread metadata

-  Destring

Resequence
~~~~~~~~~~

The ‘Resequence’ option defines the column lengths of an ASCII file.
Resequencing effectively defines the variable lengths (characters) in
the data file or the data dictionary that serves as the template
defining the variable dimensions.

The ‘Resequence’ option recalculates the Start Column and End Column
positions for the variables using information in the Widths column. For
example, if a variable has a width of 4 and a start column of 16, the
end column will be 19, i.e. the width of 4 spans columns 16, 17, 18 and
19.

The correct widths will also be calculated from the data using this
option.

When exporting to SPSS syntax or ‘Fixed format ASCII’, the start and end
column information must be present. If this is missing an error message
will be displayed requiring the use of the resequence option to add this
information to the data. Once this has been added the export function
will work correctly.

Steps to perform Resequencing:

A. Select a dataset and click on the ‘Variables’ section |image150|.
   Note that the definition of the columns are not provided and are
   filled with \*.

|image151|

B. Select the Variables>Re-sequence option and the Metadata Editor will
   compute the start and end columns. Note the resulting table will
   display the proper information and define the basic data structure.

|image152|

C. The data file can now be exported as fixed format ASCII.

Spread Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spreading metadata is a useful option to take variable information from
one file and impose the metadata on variables with the same name in
other data files. If there are common variable in all data files such as
IDs or personal attributes such as age or gender, spreading the metadata
will apply the matched variables across the files. The file of reference
is the data file where the cursor is located.

The example provided spreads the metadata from the variable DISTRICT to
three other data files where the DISTRICT variable is also located.

|image153|

The following steps are required to spread the metadata across variables
in the data files.

A. Open the data file with the reference variable and place the cursor
   in the variable with the desired metadata to be spread. The variable
   will be highlighted in blue.

B. Select the Variable>Spread metadata option. A control box will be
   provided with all the files that have a matching variable. In this
   case, three data files have the matching variable “DISTRICT”. Select
   the data files that are the target of the reference metadata.

C. Note the metadata categories that can be spread:

   |image154|

   Select the metadata items to spread. These will be shared in all
   corresponding variables in matched files.

D. Select the “Spread Metadata” option to share the metadata to the
   other data files. Now all corresponding DISTRICT variables will have
   the same content.

Destring
~~~~~~~~

The Variable>Destring option will allow the user to change a string
variable to a numeric variable. To do this, the user must select the
variable to destring. Once the operation is complete, the application
will display a screen with the variable that have undergone destringing.

Tools Menu
----------

Under the Tools Menu item there are three options provided. These
include:

-  Validate Metadata

-  Validate External Resources

-  Translation Manager

Validate Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a simple quality control step that assures that the mandatory
elements of a project template have been filled in. Mandatory elements
are defined in the template of each specific project. Using this option
will display a box with the validation result, in this case, 8 mandatory
fields are not completed.

|image155|

As indicated by the message, the elements that are not filled in will be
marked in red.

|image156|

Validate external resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like the validation of the Tools>Validate metadata, this option will
check that the mandatory elements of the Dublin Core have been
completed. As with the validation of the metadata, a result will be
displayed in a box to the user.

|image157|

The user should assure that all mandatory elements have been completed.

Translation manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Template Manager provides the user with the ability to translate the
interface of the Metadata Editor into any language. Selecting this
option will display the Translation Manager interface. When using the
option for the first time, the English template will be displayed with
all the labels that require translation.

|image158|

Note the following steps for creating a new language template.

A. Click the NEW option to the right of the Translation Manager screen.
   This will provide the user with a new file. The user must complete
   the two fields provided: 3-letter ISO code for the language and the
   name of the language. Once this has been done, click the SAVE button.

B. Note that a new language tab has been created. This language tab is
   open and will allow the user to enter content into the open fields.
   The translator should complete the fields by entering the
   corresponding translation to the right.

   |image159|

C. Save the work by clicking the SAVE button.

D. The user may now select the new language under the File>Language by
   selecting the desired language

   |image160|

   The interface will now display the labels and tags in the selected
   language.

   |image161|\ Note that the template must also be translated to assure
   the full content is in the desired language. The Translation Manager
   will only translate the interface and not the metadata labels. To
   translate the template use the Template Manager and check under the
   language folder and follow the procedure outline in the Template
   section 2.3**.

There are various other options available in the Translation Manager.
These include:

-  Edit: Allows the translator to edit the language specification or the
   ISO code and the language name.

-  Export: The language file can be exported as a ZIP file. This is
   useful if the user wants to share the language file with others.

-  Import: The user can import a language file that has been exported in
   ZIP format. Importing the language file will provide the user with
   the translated interface.

-  Close: The close option will close the interface. If any changes have
   been made in the language file, the Metadata Editor will prompt the
   user to save the changes.

   6. .. rubric:: Templates Menu
         :name: templates-menu

There are three options available under this menu item.

-  Templates

-  Data types (schema)

-  Import Schema

Templates>Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Template>template selection allows the user to work with the
template manager. This selection will have the same effect as clicking
the |image162| in the black control bar. This control has been discussed
in detail in the section entitle Templates (Section 2.3**).

2. .. rubric:: Templates>Data types (Schema)*\*
      :name: templatesdata-types-schema

3. .. rubric:: Templates>Import schema
      :name: templatesimport-schema

Selecting this option will take the user to the Windows Explorer with
the objective of selecting a JSON file schema of a template. In order to
use this option, a schema of the template has to be generated in the
Template Manager. The Template Manager provides an option to export the
template in JSON format. This file can then be shared and imported.

Note: This JSON file is also generated when using the “Package” option
and is found in the “Template” folder of the package.

Window Menu
-----------

The View Menu provides various options to the user for viewing the
screen content. The following options are provided:

-  Minimize (Ctrl+M)

   Selecting this option has the same effect as selecting the minimize
   button in the upper right hand of the screen. It will effectively
   reduce the application to the Windows application bar.

-  Reload (Ctrl+R)

   This option reloads the content from the latest saved project file.
   Note: If changes have been made to the current document and not
   saved, the changes will be lost when reloading. The content is always
   taken from the latest saved version.

-  Close

   This option will close the application and has the same effect as the
   File>Exit option. The user will be prompted to save the project
   before closing.

   8. .. rubric:: Help Menu
         :name: help-menu

Under the Help menu the user will find two options: Heath Check and
About:

-  The Health Check display a popup window that provides some
   information and diagnostics regarding the R package. The Metadata
   Editor uses R to import and export the data. The health check option
   tells the which version of R is being used on the machine. In
   addition the Health Check will provide information on the Environment
   Path and the result of the execution of the R script.

|image163|

-  The About selection is standard choice in applications and provides
   information about the most recent version of the software. If a user
   requires information on the version of the software, selecting
   Help>About will provide a pop-up box for quick reference.
